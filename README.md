This project demonstrates basic SQL operations such as creating a table, inserting data, updating values, handling nulls, filtering, and deleting records using a `users` table.
I have Created and populated a simple users table and practiced INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations, in MySQL. Handled NULL values and conditional deletions.
